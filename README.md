##HELLO!! i'm using next.js for this website:3

i made a website where if u scroll down the cards will turn the other way to show u what u want them to(u just have to configure them lolzies)

##if u have any questions about this code, feel free to ask me. 

##i'm still a beginner at coding so if u have any ways that can help me or if u see any flaws in my cody please tell me:)

i have not tested it on other devices, only on my pc so it might look weird on different resolutions!

##u can run the website using "npm run dev"
